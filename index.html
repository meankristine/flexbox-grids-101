                I was born in Abilene, TX but have lived most of my life in the Pacific Northwest. I love exploring and discovering all of the secrets that the PNW has to hold.  Some of my favorite places to explore are rainy beaches, mysterious volocanoes, and deep prehistoric woods.

                My passion: I LIVE to learn new things. I always have several new projects going that challenge me to expand my skillset and take on new perspectives in a array of areas. I love discovering something that is new and fascinating to me that I may never have given a second thought to before.

                A fun fact: I didn't completely leave my cattle-ranching roots behind. In high school I was the proud owner of an adorable dalmation spotted pig. Hormel (named by my dad) was a dainty 320 pounds but managed to win first place for his weight class.
